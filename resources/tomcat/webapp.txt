# This files shows customization people need to do to TOMCAT's server.xml in 
# order to configure the webapp.

# Add the attribute URIEncoding to the HTTP connector default port. 
# The connector will looks like:

    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
               URIEncoding="UTF-8"
               connectionTimeout="20000" 
               redirectPort="8443" />
               
# If personal portal is enabled you need to enable SSL. Follow TOMCAT SSL 
# guide. After obtained what is needed your configure the HTTP connector
# which will listen for SSL connections. It should look similar to:

<Connector port="8443" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"
               minSpareThreads="5" maxSpareThreads="75" maxThreads="200"
               enableLookups="true" disableUploadTimeout="true"
               SSLEnabled="true" keyAlias="tomcat"
               acceptCount="100" debug="0" scheme="https" secure="true"
               keystoreFile="/etc/ssl/keystore" keystorePass="changeit"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"/>
               
# A good way to increase the performance of your web site is to compress the
# response if the client supports it. TOMCAT already has native support for
# GZIP compression (You don't need to write a compression filter!) but it's
# disabled by default to enable it add the compression attribute to your HTTP
# connector. 
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" 
               URIEncoding="UTF-8"
               connectionTimeout="20000" 
               compression="1024"
               compressableMimeType="text/javascript,application/x-javascript,text/html,text/xml,application/xml,text/css,text/plain"
               redirectPort="8443" />
               
# by default HTTP access logs are disable on Tomcat. To enable it just remove 
# the comments in the AccessLogValve. It should look like:

 <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve" directory="logs"
        prefix="locahost_access_log." suffix=".txt" pattern="combined" 
        resolveHosts="false" rotatable="true" fileDateFormat="yyyy-MM-dd"/>
