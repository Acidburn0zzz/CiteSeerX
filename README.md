#CiteSeerX

This is the source code for the CiteSeerX academic digital library. 

Most of the commits were made to an old SVN repository and have since been ported to git and imported into GitHub.

The code in the master branch should always be in a production-ready state so that we can deploy it at any time, while any other experimental code or code still in development should be in separate branches and merged into the master branch via pull requests.
