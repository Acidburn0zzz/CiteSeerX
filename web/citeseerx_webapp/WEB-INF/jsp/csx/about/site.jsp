    <h2>About Citeseer<sup>x</sup></h2>
<p>Citeseer<sup>x</sup> is a scientific literature digital library and search engine that focuses primarily on the literature in computer and information science. Citeseer<sup>x</sup> aims to improve the dissemination of scientific literature and to provide improvements in functionality, usability, availability, cost, comprehensiveness, efficiency, and timeliness in the access of scientific and scholarly knowledge.</p>
<p>Rather than creating just another digital library, Citeseer<sup>x</sup> attempts to provide resources such as algorithms, data, metadata, services, techniques, and software that can be used to promote other digital libraries. Citeseer<sup>x</sup> has developed new methods and algorithms to index PostScript and PDF research articles on the Web. Citeseer<sup>x</sup> provides the following features.</p>
