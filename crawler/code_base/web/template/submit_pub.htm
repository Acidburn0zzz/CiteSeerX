<h2>Submiting Documents:</h2>
<h3>Crawling for Authors:</h3>
<p>Users are encouraged to submit content that they deem appropriate to the CiteSeer<sup>x</sup> collection. CiteSeerX crawls and indexes documents that are freely and publicly available on the Web. </p>
<p>If you do not want your documents crawled by CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>, please use a <i>robots.txt</i> to disallow our crawler named <i>citeseerxbot</i>.</p>
<p>We require that all content be submitted through links to publicly accessible documents on the Web. Please make sure you have provided relevant permissions and your <i>robots.txt</i> permits documents to be crawled by our bot <i>citeseerxbot</i>. Once we receive a link submission, that link will be queued for crawling and processed dynamically. Allow several weeks before the documents are indexed by CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>.</p>
<h3>Crawling for Open-Access Publishers, Venues, and Repositories</h3>
<p>Thank you for requesting that CiteSeer<sup>x</sup> crawl and index
your papers. It is important to note that CiteSeer<sup>x</sup> indexes papers, not
venues. Please insure the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure that your papers are in PDF. These documents should be
freely available to anyone that visits your site without any login
credentials. Currently, CiteSeer<sup>x</sup> only indexes papers written in
English. </li>
  <li> In order for CiteSeer to crawl your site, please edit your <i>robots.txt</i> file to allow our crawler to download your papers. The content of <i>robots.txt</i> should be either
    <blockquote>User-agent:*<br> Disallow:</blockquote>
to allow any crawler to completely crawl your site or
    <blockquote>User-agent: citeseerxbot<br> Allow: /yourdirectory/</blockquote>
The latter will specifically allow our crawler, <i>citeseerxbot</i>, to crawl the files in <i>/yourdirectory/</i>. </li>
  <li>We prefer a list of URLs that directly link to your PDF files. You can also generate a sitemap which contains URLs of PDF files. This
speeds up downloads. </li>
  <li>If you cannot provide direct links to the PDF files, then please provide a <i>direct link URL to the archive(s) of all of your papers</i>.
  </li>
  <li>Once crawled, your papers will then have metadata extracted, parsed, and imported into our database and then indexed. Please allow at least a week for your papers to appear in CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>. If you do not see your papers after two weeks, please contact us. </li>
</ul>
  <p><sup>*</sup>Publishers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">policy</a> on self-archiving of your publications.</p>
<h3>Supported File Formats</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>PDF:</strong> (Recommended) We are generally able to convert PDF documents in such a way as to preserve UTF-8 character codes. Therefore, we recommend submitting content in this format particulary if your files contain characters that cannot be correctly represented within the ASCII character set.</li>
<li><strong>PS:</strong> We do support PostScript files; however, text conversion will be limited to ASCII-only due to limitations in standard PostScript text extractors.</li>
<li><strong>ZIP | GZ | Z:</strong> Common compression formats such as zip, gzip, and UNIX compress are all supported.</li>
</ul>
